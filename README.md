Function and scripts I haven't found anywhere and I had to write them myself... 

This repository contains:

<b>ncart2sph.m</b> - function that computes N-dimensional transformation from Cartesian to Spherical coordinates (simple implementation)

<b>ncart2sph_fast.m</b> - same as above, but faster.

<b>wccn.m</b> - performs within-class covariance normalization.
